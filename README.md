## tic-tac-toe

Personal project from The Odin Project's Project :)

GitHub pages: https://contrigra.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/

The goal was to practice JavaScript, encapsulation, closures and different patterns, such as IIFE, factory functions, module patterns, guards and so on

I did not make a tie check functionality, as I concluded it wouldn't teach me anything new from this exercise. So, kinda practicing the cult of done.  

Figured out how to find a winner while falling a sleep, lol
### Things I practiced and learnt: 
- Function Declaration and Expression have different behaviour from Arrow Expressions
- Learn a lot about `this`
    - E.g. Arrow functions have no this, instead `this` would refer to the upper scope (e.g. window if arrow function was used in the global scope)
    - Or `this` gets figured out and bound during the runtime 
- First time used sets in JS (though used a lot in Python)
- Learnt about new methods for sets and arrays
- Lots of practice with DOM manipulation
- Lots of practice with OOP in JS. It's a bit different from what I am used to (Python)
